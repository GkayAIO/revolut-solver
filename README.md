# Revolut solver - gkay

#### I would appreciated a :star: if this helped you

Hey, this is a older not working revolut 3ds solver for Revolut personal and Revolut business. But since Revolut had the 9.2 update they changed their login. I hope this can help someone, the device ID gen should still work for the newest versions.

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me on discord: `gkay`
